the structure we've outlined for Pure Living Pro's features:

Pure Living Pro: Free vs. Premium Features
The strategy is to offer a substantial amount of valuable content and basic features for free, while reserving advanced, personalized tools and exclusive content for the Premium tier.

1. Free Tier (Accessible to all users, even without login for most content):

Blog/Wellness Insights: Access to a wide array of articles, tips, and guidance on various wellness topics (Nutrition, Mindfulness, Fitness, Natural Remedies, Healthy Recipes, Skin & Self-care).
Wellness Picks: Access to curated product recommendations with descriptions, ratings, and affiliate links.
About Us: Information about the Pure Living Pro platform, its mission, and values.
Contact Us: Ability to reach out for support or inquiries.
Basic Community Features: (Implicit, as a foundation for a community-based app).
2. Premium Tier (Requires subscription after a free trial):

This tier unlocks advanced tools, personalized experiences, and exclusive content designed to accelerate a user's wellness journey. The key features under Premium are:

3. Free Trial:

To encourage adoption, we are offering a 60-day free trial.
This trial provides full access to all Premium features without requiring payment information upfront.
The goal is to allow users to experience the full value of the Premium tier before committing to a subscription.
In essence, the free version serves as a rich content hub and a taste of the platform's value, while the Premium tier transforms it into a highly personalized and interactive wellness companion driven by AI and advanced tracking.
